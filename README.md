# RockbusterDataAnalysis
## Project Overview

Rockbuster is a movie rental company that is facing stiff competition from companies like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Their business of renting out physical copies of movies is becoming outdated as consumers now prefer to stream such movies from the aforementioned services. In order to stay relevant, they have decided to start an online rental service. The purpose of this project is to help guide the Business Intelligence (BI) department to retain and grow their customer base across the globe, taking into consideration the revenue, average rental durations, customer geographical distribution, lifetime value hotspots, and sales variation across regions. 

This is a SQL based project and utilizes PostgreSQL to analyze trends and make marketing decisions for the year 2020. 

## Key Questions & Objectives

The following are the main questions that the company would like a data analyst to answer:

- Which  movies  contributed  the  most/least  to  revenue  gain?     
- What  was  the  average  rental  duration  for  all  videos?   
- Which  countries  are  Rockbuster  customers  based  in?  
- Where  are  customers  with  a  high  lifetime  value  based?   
- Do  sales  figures  vary  between  geographic  regions?   

## Tools Used
